- **Real-Time Chat**: Reply to messages directly in the interface, sent as emails.
- **Dynamic Notifications**: Instant updates via WebSockets for new messages.
- **Intuitive Design**: A UI inspired by modern messaging apps.

### Technologies
- **Back-end**: FastAPI (Python) with WebSockets for real-time functionality.
- **Front-end**: React + TypeScript for a smooth, typed interface.
- **Integration**: Gmail API for email access.
- **Database**: (In planning, possibly MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
